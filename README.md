# DEEP-LEARNING-MODEL-FOR-PERFORMANCE-IMPROVEMENT-IN-FUTURE-ENABLED-AI--CAMERAS
AI enabled cameras have proven to be invaluable tools for various applications including
surveillance, autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. These cameras leverage deep
learning models classify objects accurately and efficiently by using Cifar-10 dataset. Traditional
computer vision techniques like rule-based algorithm often struggle with complex scenarios
and variations in lighting conditions. Also developing and maintaining these algorithms can be
expensive, Time consuming and struggle to scale effectively to meet demands of larger datasets
or more complex tasks. By leveraging deep learning techniques AI enabled cameras can adapt
and learn from large datasets and gives the results in challenging environments. One of the
prominent example is the use of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for real time detection
of objects. These systems can accurately identify and track objects of interest, enabling
proactive security measures and efficient resource allocation. CNN can learn the features of an
object through multiple iterations, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering tasks
like feature extraction. Here we use Cifar-10 dataset for object recognition which is the subset
of 80 million tiny images and consists of 60,000 32x32 colour images. These models are trained
of large scale image data sets and fine-tuned for specific object detection tasks in cameras.
